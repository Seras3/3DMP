## 2D pixel art shape.

## Vase body from scatch.
I can't lie to you, I thought it will be a difficult task :worried:. Then I realised that I know some math tricks :sunglasses:. <br>
I used [Solid of revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_of_revolution) technique. At least I was prepared to, until I saw the "REVOLVE" button that made my life easier :heart:. <br><br>
