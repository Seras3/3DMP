# Zoom in clock history :rewind:	

Devices for measuring and displaying time have started their life over 5500 years ago in ancient civilizations of Babylon and Egypt. From that point on, time started being measured with ever increasing accuracy, eventually leading us to the part of history when mechanical clocks and watches finally entered into our lives. From the moment when it represented one of the first human inventions, to the modern times when atomic clocks can precisely measure both incredibly tiny and incredibly large periods of time, the most basic principle on which every clock work is oscillation.

* [Power source](#power-source-fire)
* [Oscillator](#oscillator-balance_scale)
* [Controller](#controller-joystick) 
* [Counter chain](#counter-chain-slot_machine)
* [Indicator](#indicator-watch)

## Power source :fire:

Every clock needs to run continuously, and because of that it needs to have a source of power (sometimes even a secondary source for moments of emergency) that will drive all of its mechanisms and ensure precise and reliable measurement of time.

* Mechanical clocks can be powered by suspended weights (oscillating pendulum), sprocket, drum, or main spring.
* Electricity, which is either carried to the clock directly from the power grid, or stored in batteries.
* Automatic power sources, which use kinetic power of user’s movement to generate movement of small weights and power either mechanical mainspring or electric generator that is plugged into onboard storage medium (battery).

## Oscillator :balance_scale:

Physical harmonic oscillator is the key component of every modern clock. By providing constant frequency movement, clock’s mechanisms can capture those oscillations and transform them into precisely timed series of pulses that show us exact passage of time. Here are some of the most common oscillators:

* Balance wheel and pendulum for mechanical clocks.
* Quartz crystal in quartz clocks.
* Vibrating electrons and atoms in atomic clocks.

## Controller :joystick:

Controller is a mechanism that captures movement frequency of oscillators and converts is into series of pulses that can show us the passage of time. Two most common clock controller devices are:

* Escapement, which is used in mechanical clocks that are powered by swinging pendulums and balance wheels.
* Electronic oscillator circuit, which generates series of electrical pulses that are synchronized to the oscillator.

## Counter chain :slot_machine:

Counter chain is a mechanism that counts the pulses that were created by controller and coverts them into traditional time measuring units of seconds, minutes and hours.

## Indicator :watch:

Display portion of the clock, which has the job of visually representing information that is gathered by the remainder of clock mechanisms. Early clocks signaled time by audibly striking bells, minute hands were introduced in 1800s, digital clocks came with the expansion of modern technology in second part of 20th century, and 21st century brought us talking clocks as a part of modern portable computing world (smartphones, tablets, laptops).

# Things to have in mind before start 

If you are interested in quick modelling, in first place you should google for a project that satisfy your final desire.
Internet is full of cool stuff and you could find almost every thing you want by simply typing it.
I'll let here the [inspirational link](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3364860) for this project and I'll explain how I build it piece by piece.

First of all I downloaded the entire model and I analized it. I was overwhelmed by its complexity and that made me ask myself about a new way of designing canvases. That was funny because I thought it was only one .pdf file , that means almost 20 pieces including screws, but short time after, I realised that 3 more .pdf files were waiting for me. Well that boosted my survival skill and I tried to find a smart way to solve this mass of canvases. 

After a long adventure on the internet I found an obscure site with an older version of some kind of tool that helps with getting dimensions out of STL files and it is called Netfabb. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/3DprintFIT/netfabb-basic-download/releases).

I'm not gonna make a tutorial about his utility right now, but trust me he got all you need and is simple to use, so if you got any question you could mail me : 
```
adrian_etto@yahoo.com
```

Next steps involves modelling skills and patience and if you got enough of them you'll end up with a pretty result.
